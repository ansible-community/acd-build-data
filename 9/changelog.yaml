      minor_changes:
        - Move setuptools configuration into the declarative ``setup.cfg``
          format. ``ansible`` sdists still contain a stub ``setup.py`` file,
          but we recommend that users move to tools like pip and build and the
          PEP 517 interface instead of setuptools' deprecated ``setup.py``
          interface
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/530).
      removed_features:
        - "``cisco.nso`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the
          `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_.
          Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.nso``."
        - "``community.fortios`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the
          `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_.
          Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.fortios``."
        - "``community.google`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the
          `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_.
          Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.google``."
        - "``community.skydive`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the
          `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_.
          Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.skydive``."
        - The deprecated servicenow.servicenow collection has been removed from Ansible 7, but accidentally re-added to Ansible 8. It has been removed again from Ansible 9
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/246).
      deprecated_features:
        - The collection ``community.sap`` has been renamed to ``community.sap_libs``.
          For now both collections are included in Ansible. The content in ``community.sap``
          has deprecated redirects to the new collection in Ansible 9.0.0,
          and the collection will be removed from Ansible 10 completely. Please update your
          FQCNs for ``community.sap``.
