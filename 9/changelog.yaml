    changes:
      deprecated_features:
      - The ``community.azure`` collection is officially unmaintained and has been
        archived. Therefore, it will be removed from Ansible 10. There is already
        a successor collection ``azure.azcollection`` in the community package which
        should cover the same functionality (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/263).
      - The ``hpe.nimble`` collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed
        from Ansible 10 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 10. See
        `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/254).
      - The collection ``community.sap`` has been renamed to ``community.sap_libs``.
        For now both collections are included in Ansible. The content in ``community.sap``
        has deprecated redirects to the new collection in Ansible 9.0.0, and the collection
        will be removed from Ansible 10 completely. Please update your FQCNs for ``community.sap``.
      - The collection ``t_systems_mms.icinga_director`` has been renamed to ``telekom_mms.icinga_director``.
        For now both collections are included in Ansible. The content in ``t_systems_mms.icinga_director``
        has been replaced with deprecated redirects to the new collection in Ansible
        9.0.0, and these redirects will be removed from Ansible 11. Please update
        your FQCNs for ``t_systems_mms.icinga_director``.
      - The netapp.azure collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed
        from Ansible 10 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 10. See
        `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/234).
      - The netapp.elementsw collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed
        from Ansible 10 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 10. See
        `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/235).
      - The netapp.um_info collection is considered unmaintained and will be removed
        from Ansible 10 if no one starts maintaining it again before Ansible 10. See
        `the removal process for details on how this works <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#cancelling-removal-of-an-unmaintained-collection>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/244).
      minor_changes:
      - Move setuptools configuration into the declarative ``setup.cfg`` format. ``ansible``
        sdists still contain a stub ``setup.py`` file, but we recommend that users
        move to tools like pip and build and the PEP 517 interface instead of setuptools'
        deprecated ``setup.py`` interface (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/pull/530).

      removed_features:

        7, but accidentally re-added to Ansible 8. It has been removed again from
        Ansible 9 (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/246).
      - The ngine_io.vultr collection has been removed from Ansible 9, because it
        is officially unmaintained and has been archived. The successor collection

        but might not have compatible syntax (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/257).
