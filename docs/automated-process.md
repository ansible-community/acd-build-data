# How to release a new version of the Ansible Community Package â€” Automated Release Process

## Preamble

This document describes the (mostly) automated ansible community package
release process. The automated processes uses GitHub Actions to automate the
[manual release process](release-process.md).

!!! note
    Throughout this page, placeholder values in code blocks are formatted as
    `${PLACEHOLDER_VALUE}` where `PLACEHOLDER_VALUE` describes the value to
    specify.


## Trigger the workflow

1. Trigger [the automated
   workflow](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/actions/workflows/ansible-release.yml)
   on the **Actions** tab of the repository and specify the release version,
   such as `11.2.0` or `12.0.0rc1`, and optionally whether to preserve existing
   `.deps` files (the default is to regenerate them).

   The process will create a PR in the [`ansible-build-data`
   repository](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/).
   Afterwards, it will wait for approval before continuing with uploading the
   package to PyPI. All users in the [ansible-community/release-management-wg
   group](https://github.com/orgs/ansible-community/teams/release-management-wg)[^1]
   will be informed with a notification once the approval is needed.
   The notification includes a link to the page where the upload step can be
   approved.

2. Check out the PR in your `ansible-build-data` clone and copy the updated
   porting guide from its `${MAJOR_VERSION}` directory into the
   [`docs/docsite/rst/porting_guides/`](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-documentation/tree/devel/docs/docsite/rst/porting_guides/)
   directory of the [`ansible-documentation`
   repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-documentation/). Create a
   PR for updating the porting guide for the `devel` branch of
   `ansible-documentation`.

3. After both PRs (in `ansible-build-data` and `ansible-documentation`) are
   approved, merge the `ansible-build-data` PR and approve the next workflow
   step (**in this order!** the next steps of the workflow require the PR to be
   merged!). This will upload the package to PyPI and tag the release in
   `ansible-build-data`.

4. Merge the porting guide PR, and backport it to the latest `stable-x`
   branches down to the ansible-core version that is included in the Ansible
   release.

5. Announce the release on the Forum, Matrix, and the mailing list by running
   the following command in the `${MAJOR_VERSION}` directory of the
   `ansible-build-data` checkout:
    ```
    antsibull-build announcements --send --data-dir . ${VERSION}
    ```

[^1]: This group is configured as "Required reviewers" for the "Configure pypi"
      build environment in GitHub Actions of the `ansible-build-data` repository.
