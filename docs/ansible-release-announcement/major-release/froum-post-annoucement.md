Release announcement : Ansible Community Package X.0.0



We're happy to announce the release of the Ansible X.0.0 package!

Ansible X.0.0 requires latest version of ansible-core a.b and includes a curated set of Ansible collections that provides a vast number of modules and plugins. This is a major release of Ansible.

ansible-core is a required dependency, not contained within the ansible packages. Pip install builds the
dependency, but it can be built and installed quite independently of the "ansible" distribution.

The "ansible" distribution

This release is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip:
