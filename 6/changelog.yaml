  6.0.0a2:
    changes:
      removed_features:
        - The community.kubevirt collection has been removed from Ansible 6.
          It has not been working with the community.kubernetes collection included
          since Ansible 5.0.0, and unfortunately nobody managed to adjust the
          collection to work with kubernetes.core >= 2.0.0. If you need to use this
          collection, you need to manually install community.kubernetes < 2.0.0
          together with community.kubevirt with
          ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubevirt 'community.kubernetes:<2.0.0'``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/92).
        - The community.kubernetes collection has been removed from Ansible 6.
          It has been deprecated since Ansible 4.2, and version 2.0.0 included since
          Ansible 5 is only a set of deprecated redirects from community.kubernetes
          to kubernetes.core. If you still need the redirects, you can manually install
          community.kubernetes with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubernetes``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/93).
