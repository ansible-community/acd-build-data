      removed_features:
      - The community.kubernetes collection has been removed from Ansible 6. It has
        been deprecated since Ansible 4.2, and version 2.0.0 included since Ansible
        5 is only a set of deprecated redirects from community.kubernetes to kubernetes.core.
        If you still need the redirects, you can manually install community.kubernetes
        with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubernetes`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/93).
      - The community.kubevirt collection has been removed from Ansible 6. It has
        not been working with the community.kubernetes collection included since Ansible
        5.0.0, and unfortunately nobody managed to adjust the collection to work with
        kubernetes.core >= 2.0.0. If you need to use this collection, you need to
        manually install community.kubernetes < 2.0.0 together with community.kubevirt
        with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubevirt 'community.kubernetes:<2.0.0'``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/92).

    changes:
      deprecated_features:
      - The collection ``community.sap`` has been renamed to ``community.sap_libs``.
        For now both collections are included in Ansible. The content in ``community.sap``
        will be replaced with deprecated redirects to the new collection in Ansible
        7.0.0, and these redirects will eventually be removed from Ansible. Please
        update your FQCNs for ``community.sap``.
