  6.0.0a2:
    changes:
      removed_features:
        - The community.kubevirt collection has been removed from Ansible 6.
          It has not been working with the community.kubernetes collection included
          since Ansible 5.0.0, and unfortunately nobody managed to adjust the
          collection to work with kubernetes.core >= 2.0.0. If you need to use this
          collection, you need to manually install community.kubernetes < 2.0.0
          together with community.kubevirt
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/92).
