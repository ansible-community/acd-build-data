      breaking_changes:
      - "ansible.windows.win_find - module has been refactored to better match the
        behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:\n  * When the
        directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer
        fail and will just warn the user\n  * Junction points are no longer reported
        as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour
        matches the ansible.windows.win_stat module\n  * Directories no longer return
        a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been
        removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory\n"
      - cisco.nxos.nxos_igmp_interface - no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix``
        and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
      - community.grafana.grafana_dashboard - the parameter ``message`` is renamed
        to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
      - community.windows.win_pester - no longer runs all ``*.ps1`` file in the directory
        specified due to it executing potentially unknown scripts. It will follow
        the default behaviour of only running tests for files that are like ``*.tests.ps1``
        which is built into Pester itself.
      - purestorage.flashblade.purefb_fs - no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs``
        option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.
      deprecated_features:
      - The vyos.vyos.vyos_static_route module has been deprecated and will be removed
        in a later release; use vyos.vyos.vyos_static_routes instead.
      - ansible.windows.win_domain_controller - the ``log_path`` option has been deprecated
        and will be removed in a later release. This was undocumented and only related
        to debugging information for module development.
      - ansible.windows.win_package - the ``ensure`` alias for the ``state`` option
        has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please use ``state``
        instead of ``ensure``.
      - ansible.windows.win_package - the ``productid`` alias for the ``product_id``
        option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please
        use ``product_id`` instead of ``productid``.
      - 'ansible.windows.win_package - the ``username`` and ``password`` options has
        been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. The same functionality
        can be done by using ``become: yes`` and ``become_flags: logon_type=new_credentials
        logon_flags=netcredentials_only`` on the task.'
